# AI Context

**Read this first if you're an AI assistant.** Dense pointer-and-rule reference. Designed for fast onboarding. Most current state lives in `HANDOFF.md` and `systems.md`; this file is the stable spine.

## Project (3 lines)

**Lithos** — React 19 + Vite browser-only incremental/idle game with cosmic horror flavor.
Long arc: 8 eras (Scavenger → Awakening → Settler → Awakened World → Arcane Industry → Eldritch Reckoning → Ascendant → Cosmic). Currently shipped: **Era 0–3 with full RPG combat, tiered water, Arcane Studies, World Score, death-debuff cascade, and equipped-weapon foundation**.
Solo passion project, Steam-bound eventually. Accessibility-first, moddability-ready, content-as-data.

## Stack

- React 19, Vite, plain JS (no TypeScript)
- State: `useReducer` (`src/state/store.js`)
- Save: `localStorage` key `namigatchi-save` (versioned schema — current `v4`, with migration chain `v1 → v2 → v3 → v4`)
- Settings: separate `localStorage` key `namigatchi-settings` (theme, fonts, keybinds, volumes, motion, inventory collapse state, eat preference, drink preference)
- No backend, no build steps beyond `npm install && npm run dev`

## Architectural rules (NEVER violate without explicit user permission)

1. **Content as data.** `src/content/*.js` are pure data objects. No functions inside content. Predicates are flag-based (`requires: { rockAwakened: true }`), not functions.
2. **Thin reducer.** `src/state/reducer.js` dispatches; gameplay logic lives in `src/systems/*.js`. Each system function is pure (state in → new state out + log events).
3. **Persistent vs run state split.** `state.persistent` survives prestige forever (echoes, run history, unlocked music, lifetime stats, altar etchings, **permanently-known resources**). `state.run` wipes on prestige/reset. Save format already supports this; respect it for every new piece of state.
4. **Pure scene composition.** UI doesn't decide what to show — `src/systems/scene.js` does. UI just renders the layer list.
5. **Modal pattern for content-heavy UI.** Trees (research, buildings, **studies**) and rich screens (settings) live in modals triggered from a compact card in the main UI.
6. **Accessibility first.** Reduced motion (`body.motion-reduced` or `prefers-reduced-motion` media query), accessibility fonts (Lexend, Atkinson Hyperlegible), photosensitivity considered for any flashing content.
7. **Hidden alignment + hidden World Score.** `run.alignment.good` / `run.alignment.evil` track silently. NEVER display the numbers. `run.worldScore` is also hidden until the apex (≥100) reveal. Surfaces through consequences, not numbers.
8. **Anti-spam from day one.** Gather has a cooldown (1500ms → 250ms with progression). `e.repeat` filtered in keybindings — holding a key doesn't auto-fire. Manual click → faster manual click → automation is the entire incremental progression curve.
9. **Virtual-water cost key.** Building/research/tool/survival cost entries use the literal string `"water"` to mean "any water tier." Resolved via `totalWater()` / `spendWater()` from `content/resources.js`. **Never** add direct `water_stagnant` etc. costs to recipes unless the recipe genuinely requires a *specific* tier (e.g. boil action consumes water_muddy).
10. **Equip/cast/drink/etc. don't pause studies; gather/build/eat/etc. do.** The Arcane Studies clock pauses on world-affecting player actions but not on housekeeping. The reducer is the source of truth — only player-action cases call `appendLogAndStamp` (which writes `lastActionAt`).

## How to add common things

| Goal | Primary file | Also touch | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| New resource | `content/resources.js` | — | `category` controls inventory section; `hiddenUntil` for mystery; `deathDebuffRecovery` if food/drink helps recover from death-cascade |
| New building | `content/buildings.js` | — | `tier`+`col`+`parents` for tree; `effect.gatherSpeedup` for cooldown; `effect.sanityPerMinute` for passive stat trickle |
| New research node | `content/research.js` | — | same tree fields; whisper text required; cost `water: N` is the virtual-water key |
| New arcane study node | `content/studies.js` | — | `path` (one of 7), `tier`, `col`, `parents`, `durationMs`, `cost`, `effect.{unlocksSpell|passive|addsStat}` |
| New threat (one-shot) | `content/threats.js` | — | `encounterChance` per gather; `effects.{stealFood|damage|sanityDrain}` |
| New threat (combat-class) | `content/threats.js` | — | add `combat: { hp, acc, eva, damage, damageType }` and `combatFlavor: { opener, attack, miss, victory, defeat }` |
| New weapon (pure combat) | `content/weapons.js` | — | `type`, `subfamily`, `weaponStats: { damage, acc, crit }`, `durability: { wearsOn: "combat" }` |
| New tool with combat use | `content/tools.js` | — | add `weaponStats` field alongside existing `effect` — that's the dual-use pattern |
| New event | `content/events.js` | — | `trigger: interval/gather/any`; `choices` array; optional `worldScoreDelta` per choice |
| New music/SFX | run `npm run add-audio` | — | tool handles file copy + entry; tag `eraN` for auto-unlock |
| New setting | `state/settings.js` SETTINGS_DEFAULTS | `ui/SettingsModal.jsx` | applies via body class or component prop |
| New keybind | `state/settings.js` keybindings | `ui/useKeybindings.js` ACTION_HANDLERS | rebind UI auto-supports new entries |
| New action | `state/actions.js` ACTIONS | reducer case + system fn + `store.js` actions wrapper | follow existing pattern; player actions use `appendLogAndStamp`, housekeeping uses `appendLog` |
| New era | `systems/era.js` computeEra() | content tagged with eraN | era is derived, not stored |
| New log kind | `content/logKinds.js` | `index.css` `.log-entry--X` | `category: "recent"` or `"unlocks"`; CSS picks color |
| New spell unlocked by study | `content/spells.js` | — | use `requires: { studied: <studyId> }` instead of `requires.researched` |
| New death-cure consumable | `content/tools.js` | — | add `deathDebuffRecovery: 0.NN` field; reduceDeathDebuff fires automatically in performUseTool |
| New combat-resolution rule | `systems/combat.js` | — | resolveFight is the entry point; respect damageType routing |

## Common reducer patterns

**Player-initiated action (pauses studies):**
```js
case ACTIONS.GATHER: {
  const { run, persistent, events } = performGather(state);
  return { persistent, run: appendLogAndStamp(run, events) };
}
```

**Housekeeping action (does NOT pause studies):**
```js
case ACTIONS.EQUIP: {
  const { run, events } = performEquip(state, action.id, action.slot);
  return { persistent: state.persistent, run: appendLog(run, events) };
}
```

**TICK** runs in order: passiveProduction → spoilage → diseases → studies → worldScore → pests → events. Each tick fn returns `{ run, events }` (or `{ run, persistent, events }` if it writes to persistent — see tickStudies for altar etchings).

---

## Workflow on session start

1. Read this file (you're done).
2. Read `docs/HANDOFF.md` for current state + immediate next moves.
3. If working on a specific system, skim its entry in `docs/systems.md` (find by header).
4. Glance at the relevant `src/` files.
5. **Ask the user what they want before assuming.** Don't enumerate features — pick a direction together.

## When in doubt

- "How does X work mechanically?" → `docs/systems.md` (find entry, see "Where" pointer)
- "Where is X in the code?" → systems.md "Where" pointer
- "What was decided about Y?" → `docs/roadmap.md` for vision, `docs/ERA_PLAN.md` for active design + locked decisions
- "What patterns does code use?" → here (top of file) + `docs/architecture.md` v2 addendum
- "What bugs are known?" → `docs/BUGS.md`
- "What's planned for upcoming eras?" → `docs/ERA_PLAN.md`
- "How do I add audio?" → `tools/README.md`, `npm run add-audio`

## Sandbox caveat for AI agents

The local Linux mount frequently lags behind file-tool edits. Bash `wc -l` / `cat` / `node -e parse` may see truncated stale versions of recently-edited files. **The Read tool is authoritative.** When acorn-jsx parses fail with errors near the truncation point but Read shows complete files, trust Read and proceed.

## Quick smoke test

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
Open `http://localhost:5173`. To test fresh: open dev tools → Application → Local Storage → delete `namigatchi-save` → reload. Or use the dev panel's **💥 Nuke save (reload)** in the System tab.
