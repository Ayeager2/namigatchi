// Boss-fight resolution — commit phase only (#40).
//
// The BossFightModal runs the turn-based fight client-side using the
// rollPlayerAttack / rollFoeAttack helpers from combat.js. Spells and
// items the player triggers during a fight dispatch the normal
// CAST_SPELL / USE_TOOL actions (real spirit/fragments/inventory cost,
// real cooldowns), so by the time we get here the only thing left to
// commit is:
//   • damage the foe inflicted on the player (hp / sanity / spirit deltas)
//   • victory bookkeeping — defeatReward, firstDefeatLog, etching, XP
//   • defeat bookkeeping — death-debuff cascade (no run reset)
//   • flee bookkeeping — damage applied, no rewards
//
// Boss content lives in content/bosses.js. See ERA_PLAN.md "Combat +
// Weapons + Specialized Skills" → "Boss fights".
