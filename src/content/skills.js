// Skill definitions — DATA, not code.
// Skills are the "learning by doing" axis. Every meaningful action grants XP
// to the matching skill. Skills level up; levels grant declarative bonuses
// that the systems read at runtime.
//
// Lifecycle: skills are RUN-LOCAL. They wipe on prestige. Each new awakening
// is a new body learning the world fresh. Future Echo upgrades may grant
// "start with +N levels in skill X" perks — that's the persistent layer's
// job, not this one.
//
// Each skill has:
//   id, name, icon, description     — basic identity
//   active                          — true: earns XP today; false: stub for a future era
//   category                        — grouping for UI ("survival" | "craft" | "industry" | "arcane")
//   xpCurve                         — declarative XP curve. Currently:
//                                     { type: "exponential", base, multiplier, cap }
//                                     XP needed to reach level N is
//                                     base * multiplier^(N-1), capped at maxLevel
//   maxLevel                        — soft cap for current era; raised as content arrives
//   bonuses                         — array of { stat, perLevel, max? } entries
//                                     interpreted by skills.getBonus(state, stat)
//   firstUnlockMessage              — log line on reaching level 1 (the "I'm getting it" beat)
//
// Bonuses are pure data: { stat: "huntCooldownReduction", perLevel: 300, max: 4500 }
// means each level reduces hunt cooldown by 300ms, capped at 4500ms total.
// New bonuses = new entries; the system reads whatever stats it cares about.
